# Welcome to Markov's Documentation!
 
Markov creates 'Virtual Users' to extensively test your software applications. More specifically, it is a service that mimics human users for your application in terms of their HTTP traffic. All Markov needs to take in are your API requests. Best yet, Markov is totally customizable: you have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to it and which features to test.

The service operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:
