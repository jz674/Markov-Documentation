# [Markov.run][5] 
## Design and Create Behavioral Scripts Effortlessly and Automatically
> Made by Developers for Developers

Markov creates [synthetic users][6] to proactively test your software and trigger issues before your users do. Our synthetic users behave just like your real users would, allowing Markov to ensure previously developed software still works as expected. Unliked other testing tools, Markov applies a probabilistic model for creating test cases and is self-driven with no maintaince or special training needed.

# Mission
Empowers companies of all sizes to redirect their limited resources to innovating and launching to market without compromsing user experience.



# How Does Markov Work
All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us and which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Value Proposition - Business
1. Reduce Quality Assurance staffing
2. Reduce the manual labor of handcrafting user scripts
3. Launch products to market faster without compromising quality
4. Aggressively test your software, so users don't find issues first
5. Empower your Engineering team to spend more time innovating and less concerned with testing
6. Modernize your legacy software for faster performance and better user experience
7. Super easy to set up, non-disruptive, no specialized training needed, and self-maintained

# Value Proposition - Software
1. Stop manually creating developing user scripts to [API/Service testing][2] 
2. Focus your limited Engineering resources on developing features and improving performance
3. Test thoroughly against the most active and common paths your users take
4. Execute regression test suite conveniently from your Command Line Interface for faster results
5. Update your legacy API or Add new API library with confidence that the product has not regressed

# FAQ
1. How will Markov handle the privacy of our users' API calls?
> Markov will serialized your forwarded API calls to ensure upmost security

2. What will we need to get started?
> TBD

3. How is Markov different from other testing libraries like Jest or Selenium?
> All those require manually writing test scripts, regular maintained, high level of expertise, and very disruptive to set up
Markov addresses all of those pain points


# Note
Beta is expected to launch in May 2021 - high hopes we can launch sooner :)
