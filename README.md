# Markov.run: Catch Bugs Before Your Users Do
 
Markov automates the manual process of creating test scripts to make sure code changes do not break existing functionality.

Focused on the [API/Service/Business layer of testing][2], Markov provides confidence that new functionalities will not systemically break previously developed software. We do this by enabling you to [regression test][1] on-demand within your Git workflow.

Markov generates 'Virtual Users", which behave and act just as your real user would, to catch issues in your staging environment. More specifically, Markov mimics human users for your application in terms of their HTTP traffic. All Markov needs to take in are your API requests. Best yet, Markov is totally customizable: you have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us and which features to test.

Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# 0. Business Value
1. Reduce time spent handcrafting Automation Scripts
2. Realistic test your application at scale before Production
3. Extensive coverage on happy paths and edge cases
4. Seamless integration - No maintenance or specialized training needed
5. Dead simple to get started

# 1. Getting Started
[Request Early Access][3], and instructions will follow.

# 2. Pricing
[Request Early Access and Beta Test][3], and you will get Markov for free.

# 3. [Demo][4]
* Contrary to demo, Markov v1.0 have Command Line Interface - not Graphic User Inferface *
# 4. Contact
