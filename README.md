# [Markov.run][5]
 
Markov creates [synthetic users][6] to proactively test your software and trigger issues before your users do. Our synthetic users behave just like your real users would, allowing Markov to ensure previously developed software still works as expected accurately. Markov empowers companies of all sizes to focus less on [regression testing][1] and more on innovating.

# How Does Markov Work?

All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us and which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Value Proposition - Business
1. Reduce Quality Assurance staffing
2. Reduce the manual labor of handcrafting user scripts
3. Launch products to market faster without compromising quality
4. Aggressively test your software, so users don't find issues first
5. Empower your Engineering team to spend more time innovating and less concerned with testing
6. Modernize your legacy software for faster performance and better user experience
7. Super easy to set up, non-disruptive, no specialized training needed, and self-maintained

# Value Proposition - Software
1. Stop manually creating developing user scripts to [API/Service testing][2] 
2. Focus your limited Engineering resources on developing features and improving performance
3. Test thoroughly against the most active and common paths your users take
4. Execute regression test suite conveniently from your Command Line Interface for faster results
5. Update your legacy API or Add new API library with confidence that the product has not regressed
