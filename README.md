# What is Markov
Markov assures bulletproof and comprehensive test coverage for new functionalities by forwarding synthetic traffic to your test servers. 

Our traffic is modeled your customers' behavior to realistically test the robustness of your application. Our goal is to break the API layer of your application with our synthetic traffic before your customers do. 

# How Does Markov Work
All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us, and in turn, which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Why use Markov? - Engineering/Product Managers
1. Aggressively trigger bugs before your customers do
2. Auto create and update suites of regression tests
3. Reduce downtime and deployment time
4. Analyze and forecast customer behavior patterns
5. No maintenance or special training needed


# Why use Markov? - Software Engineers
1. Record and replay broken scenarios
2. Assure quality test coverage before negative user exp.
3. Realistically load/stress/performance/regression test
4. Specify parts of your API to test
5. Super easy setup and built into your git workflow

# Getting Started

## Prerequisite
- Web application that makes REST API calls
- Host a test environment
- Clone production databases to test environment
- Monitor test environment

# FAQ
1. How will Markov handle the privacy of our users' API calls?
> Markov will serialized your forwarded API calls to ensure upmost security

2. What will we need to get started?
> [Getting Started](#getting-started)


3. How is Markov different from other testing libraries like Jest or Selenium?
> All those require manually writing test scripts, regular maintained, high level of expertise, and very disruptive to set up
Markov addresses all of those pain points
