## Automatically Design and Update Test Scripts 
> Made by Developers for Developers

Markov creates [synthetic users][6] that behave like your real users. Our synthetic users will forward their [API request traffic][2] to your test server, where you can [synthetic monitor][9] your application's health anytime you commit a change.

# Mission
To empower companies of all sizes to focus on innovation and launching to markets faster without compromsing user experience.

# How Does Markov Work
All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us and which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Why use Markov? - Business
1. Find bugs before your users do
2. Reduce QA headcount
3. Save hours handcrafting scripts
4. Launch faster without compromising quality
5. Modernize your legacy software


# Why use Markov? - Software
1. Mimic real usage patterns
2. Regression test and load test on git commit
3. Synthetic monitor test traffic 
4. No maintenance or special training needed
5. Super easy to set up

# FAQ
1. How will Markov handle the privacy of our users' API calls?
> Markov will serialized your forwarded API calls to ensure upmost security

2. What will we need to get started?
> TBD

3. How is Markov different from other testing libraries like Jest or Selenium?
> All those require manually writing test scripts, regular maintained, high level of expertise, and very disruptive to set up
Markov addresses all of those pain points
