## Deploy with Confidence
> Made by Developers for Developers

Markov ensures that any changes you make to your application still perform as expected.

Markov does this by forwarding synthetic user traffic to your test servers. The synthetic traffic models your customers' behavior so we can realistically test the robustness of your test cases and trigger bugs/edge cases before your users do.

# Mission
A vanguard for tech companies to update their test cases and prevent poor user experiences.

# How Does Markov Work
All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us, and in turn, which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Why use Markov? - Business
1. Trigger bugs before your customers do
2. Identify gaps in your test cases
3. Analyze and forecast user behavior patterns
4. Feel confident about happy paths and random edge cases
5. No maintenance or special training needed

# Why use Markov? - Software
1. Update test cases before a bad user experience
2. Config traffic volume and duration
3. Specify parts of your API to test
4. Built into your git workflow
5. Super easy setup 

# Getting Started

## Prerequisite
- A test environment
- Ability to monitor the environment
- Web application that makes REST API calls

# FAQ
1. How will Markov handle the privacy of our users' API calls?
> Markov will serialized your forwarded API calls to ensure upmost security

2. What will we need to get started?
> TBD

3. How is Markov different from other testing libraries like Jest or Selenium?
> All those require manually writing test scripts, regular maintained, high level of expertise, and very disruptive to set up
Markov addresses all of those pain points
