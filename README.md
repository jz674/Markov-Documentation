# [Markov.run][5]
 
Markov creates 'synthetic users' to catch bugs before your users do. These 'synthetic users' behave just like your real users. 

# How Does Markov Work?

All you need to do is forward your users' API requests traffic to Markov. You have total autonomy in choosing which requests you want to forward to us and which features to test.

Essentially, Markov operates in two steps. Below is a diagram depicting the functionality of the service:

# Value Proposition - Web App Startups 
1. Reduce the manual labor of handcrafting user scripts
2. Push new code/changes with confidence that previously built software still works
3. Spent less time API/Service Testing and more on growing product
4. Seamless integration - No maintenance or specialized training needed
5. Dead simple to get started

# Value Proposition - Enterprise
1. Update legacy software with confidence
2. And everything above ^^^

# Getting Started
[Request Early Access][3], and instructions will follow.

# Pricing
